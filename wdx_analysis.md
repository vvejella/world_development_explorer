# Individual Project-1

##### The World Development Indicators (WDI) is the World Bankâ€™s premier compilation of cross-country historical data on development. The dataset includes more than 1400 socioeconomic indicators of 200 plus countries over 50 plus years. It is rich in information about a country's economy, environment, people, and healthcare (The World Bank, 2021).

##### The WDX is web-based, cloud-hosted, and free for all to use anywhere anytime with Internet connection. Users can visually and interactively explore trends and relations and compare countries and regions. The beautiful and informative charts are of publication-quality and can be readily downloaded for use in blogs, presentations, reports, and papers.

I found some topics whcih seems interesting during exploration of the data of World Development Explorer site. They are:

1. Energy mining, Enviornment and Health these are the 3 topics which I choose first to know about % of Electricity access, what % of electricity is produced from Oil,gas,coal and what % of age dependancy ratio(% working-age population) are using electricity. 
- The indicator about Electricity access means % of population with access to electricity. Here data is taken from industries, national surveys.
- The indicator about what % of electricity is produced from Oil,gas,coal resources refers to inputs used to produce electricity here oil means crude oil and petroleum products, coal refers to all coal and brown coal, fuel refers to derived fuels.
- The indicator about % of age dependancy ratio(% working-age population) means it is the ratio of dependants younger than 15 or older than 64. Data is shown as proportion of dependents per 100 working-age population.
- I want to analyse this issue by comparing the access of electricity and how much % of electricity produced from Oil,gas,coal resources used by the working-age population.
- I want to know this to see what % of dependants are using electricity mainly from the oil, coal resources.
- I took North America and South Asia regions for comparision with time span of 7 years.
- Refer the Electricity named graphs for the comparision.

According to above grapgh Inida is highest in my analysis.

According to above bar graph for last 10 years,South Asia is using more Electricity than North-America.

2. Next 3 topics are Urban development, Education and Infrastructure to know about what % of Urban population(% total population), and Population, ages(15-24) total are using Vehicles(per km of Road).  
- The indicator about % of Urban population(% total population) means the people living in Urban areas. Here Data is collected from United Nations Population Division.
- The indicator about Population, ages(15-24) total means total population age 15-24. Here data is collected from UNESCO Institute of statistics.
- The indicator about Vehicles(per km of Road) means vehicles per km of Road include cars, buses and road means highways, national roads, regional roads and other roads. Data is taken from International road federation, world road statistics.
- I want to analyse this issue by comparing the usage of vehicles(per km on road) by Urban population(% total population) and Population b/w 15-24 mainly in different regions.
- I took Middle-East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa regions for comparision with time span of 10 years.
- Refer the urban population, vehicles, population and Urban named graphs for the comparision.

according to above graph Kenya is using more vehicles.

according to above bar graph for period b/w 2008-13 the Middle-east africa is using vehicles more.


3. Next 3 topics are Private sector,Education and Science & Technology topics to know what % Labour tax and contributions(% of commercial profits) and Literacy rate,youth total(% of people age 15-24)  are working as Technicians in R&D(per million people). 
- The indicator about % Labour tax and contributions(% of commercial profits) means amount of taxes and mandatory contributions on labor paid by business. Data is taken from world bank, https://www.doingbusiness.org/.
-  The indicator about Literacy rate,youth total(% of people age 15-24) means the percentage of people ages 15-24 who can read and write. Here data is collected from UNESCO Institute of statistics.
-  The indicator about Technicians in R&D(per million people) means number of technicians participated in Research and development, R&D covers basic research and experimental developemnt. Here data is collected from UNESCO Institute of statistics.
-  I want to analyse this issue how many % Labour tax and contributions(% of commercial profits) given to r&d technicians b/w Literacy rate,youth total(% of people age 15-24).
-  Here I took Europe and Central-Asia, East Asia & Pacific, Latin America and Caribbean regions with a time span of 10 years.
-  Refer the labour vs literacy vs r&d and labour named graphs for the comparision.
