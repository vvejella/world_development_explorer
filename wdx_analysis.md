#### The World Development Indicators (WDI) is the World Bankâ€™s premier compilation of cross-country historical data on development. The dataset includes more than 1400 socioeconomic indicators of 200 plus countries over 50 plus years. It is rich in information about a country's economy, environment, people, and healthcare (The World Bank, 2021).

#### The WDX is web-based, cloud-hosted, and free for all to use anywhere anytime with Internet connection. Users can visually and interactively explore trends and relations and compare countries and regions. The beautiful and informative charts are of publication-quality and can be readily downloaded for use in blogs, presentations, reports, and papers.

I found some topics whcih seems interesting during exploration of the data of World Development Explorer site. They are:

1. Energy mining, Enviornment and Health these are topics which I choose first to know about % of Electricity access, what % of electricity is produced from Oil,gas,coal and what % of age dependancy ratio(% working-age population) are using electricity. 
a) The indicator about Electricity access means % of population with access to electricity. Here data is taken from industries, national surveys.
b) The indicator about what % of electricity is produced from Oil,gas,coal resources refers to inputs used to produce electricity here oil means crude oil and petroleum products, coal refers to all coal and brown coal, fuel refers to derived fuels.
c) The indicator about % of age dependancy ratio(% working-age population) means it is the ratio of dependants younger than 15 or older than 64. Data is shown as proportion of dependents per 100 working-age population.
