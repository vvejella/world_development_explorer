# Individual Project-1

##### The World Development Indicators (WDI) is the World Bankâ€™s premier compilation of cross-country historical data on development. The dataset includes more than 1400 socioeconomic indicators of 200 plus countries over 50 plus years. It is rich in information about a country's economy, environment, people, and healthcare (The World Bank, 2021).

##### The WDX is web-based, cloud-hosted, and free for all to use anywhere anytime with Internet connection. Users can visually and interactively explore trends and relations and compare countries and regions. The beautiful and informative charts are of publication-quality and can be readily downloaded for use in blogs, presentations, reports, and papers.

I found some topics whcih seems interesting during exploration of the data of World Development Explorer site. They are:

1. Energy mining, Enviornment and Health these are the 3 topics which I choose first to know about % of Electricity access, what % of electricity is produced from Oil,gas,coal and what % of age dependancy ratio(% working-age population) are using electricity. 
- The indicator about Electricity access means % of population with access to electricity. Here data is taken from industries, national surveys.
- The indicator about what % of electricity is produced from Oil,gas,coal resources refers to inputs used to produce electricity here oil means crude oil and petroleum products, coal refers to all coal and brown coal, fuel refers to derived fuels.
- The indicator about % of age dependancy ratio(% working-age population) means it is the ratio of dependants younger than 15 or older than 64. Data is shown as proportion of dependents per 100 working-age population.
- I want to analyse this issue by comparing to know what % of electricity is accessed by working-age population and how much % of electricity produced from Oil,gas,coal resources used by the working-age population in the different countries.
- This will help me to know how much usage of electricity and mainly the electricity which is produced from coal,oil,gas resources used by working-age population.
- I did comparision between India, Srilanka which are still developing countries with the developed countries like Canada and United States with a timespan of 7 years b/w 2013-2020.

according to above bubble graph India is highest in my analysis with the highest access of Electricity.

Here in this Pie chart, we can see the United states and Canada are same in usage of electricity.

In above pie chart, I observed Srilanka is not there in the diagram and India is lowest in accessing electricity during past years like 1995-1997.

Here in Bargraph, I observed for past years, India is second lowest and Srilanka is not there in the graph during the comparsion b/w other 2 countries in the years between 2000-2010.


2. Next 3 topics are Urban development, Education and Infrastructure to know about what % of Urban population(% total population), and what % Population, ages(15-24), what % of Railway passengers carried(million passenger-km). 
- The indicator about % of Urban population(% total population) means the people living in Urban areas. Here Data is collected from United Nations Population Division.
- The indicator about Population, ages(15-24) total means total population age 15-24. Here data is collected from UNESCO Institute of statistics.
- The indicator about Railway passengers carried(million passenger-km) means passengers carried by railway are the number of passenegrs transported by rail times kms travelled. Here data is collected from Internation union of Railways(UIC).
- I want to analyse this issue by comparing the usage of Railway by Urban population(% total population) and in that mainly by Population b/w 15-24 mainly in various countries.
- This will help me to know how much % of youth using Railway mainly in Urban cities.
- I did comparision between Bangladesh which is still developing country with the developed countries like China, Germany and Japan with a timespan of 10 years b/w 2010-2020.

according to above graph China is highest in the count of Railway passengers and Urban population.

Here in the Pie-chart, China is highest in using Railway more than other 3 countries.

Here in the above pie chart, Japan and China are almost same in usage of Railways compared to the  past years during 1995-2001.

Here in Bargraph, I observed for past years, Japan is highest in in the count of Railway passengers during the comparsion b/w other countries during 1995-2001.
